Practice:

build database

ruby 2.1.3p242 (newest version)
uninstall rails- version:
- gem uninstall rails -v 4.2.0
- gem install rails -v 4.1.4
=================================================================
POSTGRESQL

rails new myapp --database=postgresql

switch into the Postgres user:
su - postgres

development:
  adapter: postgresql
  encoding: unicode
  database: myapp_development
  pool: 5
  username: myapp
  password: password1

test:
  adapter: postgresql
  encoding: unicode
  database: myapp_test
  pool: 5
  username: myapp
  password: password1

  +++++++++++++++++
You can then run:

rake db:setup


========================================================
You will not be able to find out the password he chose. However, you may create a new user or set a new password to the existing user.

Usually, you can login as the postgres user:

Open a Terminal and do sudo su postgres. Now, after entering your admin password, you are able to launch psql and do

CREATE USER yourname WITH SUPERUSER PASSWORD 'yourpassword';
This creates a new admin user. If you want to list the existing users, you could also do

\du
to list all users and then

ALTER USER yourusername WITH PASSWORD 'yournewpass';
