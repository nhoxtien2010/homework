config vitual host:
On most systems the Apache configuration file is located in either /etc/apache2/httpd.conf or /etc/apache2/apache2.conf. However, to allow better organization, many operating systems and Apache distributions also read configuration files in the conf.d, mods-enabled and sites-enabled subdirectories.
mods-enabled contains symlinks to files in mods-available. This latter subdirectory contains config files for all available modules, while mods-enabled contains only a subset, namely the modules that should actually be enabled. The symlinks are created using the a2enmod tool. .load files contain LoadModule directives, while .conf files contain all other configuration directives.
Use mods-enabled/mods-available to store Phusion Passenger configuration if you can:
Create /etc/apache2/mods-available/passenger.load and paste the LoadModule ... directive that passenger-install-apache2-module outputs.
Create /etc/apache2/mods-available/passenger.conf and paste the PassengerRoot and other Phusion Passenger options.
Enable by running sudo a2enmod passenger.
If the mods-enabled mechanism is not available then you can paste configuration snippets into httpd.conf or apache2.conf directly.
On OS X Server >= 10.8 Mountain Lion the location of the Apache configuration file depends on whether you use Web Services or not. If you do, then the configuration file is in /Library/Server/Web/Config/apache2/httpd_server_app.conf. If you do not, then the configuration file is in /etc/apache2/httpd.conf.
================================================
content of config:
-VirtualHost you can change the port that apache will be listening for this app. This case is 3000.
-PassengerRuby you must paste what you have got from the previous command.
-ServerName is your server name or its IP address.
-DocumentRoot should be pointing to your app public folder.
-Directory is the same as line 4.
-ErrorLog and CustomLog are custom log files, so it makes easy to manage the logs if you have multiple apps. If you want these lines you have to create the directory.
